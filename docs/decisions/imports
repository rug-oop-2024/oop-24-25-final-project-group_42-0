# Motivation for different imports

# import-0001: sklearn
# files: - logistic_regression_wrapper.py
#        - random_forest_classifier_wrapper.py
#        - random_forest_regressor_wrapper.py
#        - sklearn_wrap.py

# Decision: import sklearn for regression and classification models
# Status: Accepted
# Motivation: Ease of use and lighter workload
# Reason: Using the facade design pattern we can make a
# more effective implementation of logistic regression, random forest classifier,
# random forest regressor and lasso
# and it saves time so that we can focus on other parts of the code
# Limitations: More difficult to change functionality if needed
# Alternatives: Make the class ourselves.
